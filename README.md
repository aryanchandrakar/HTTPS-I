The threat of MITM and port listening leaves us with no other way than encrypting and hiding the data and using it as a way to communicate across the world wide web. While encryption is provided in different various forms including both symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods, we still need a way to hide the data. Inspired from the ancient roman tablet used for communication, without anyone having any suspicion about the information being there at the first place. The approach we would be using for hiding the data would be from steganography, breaking the limits of communication protocols that are being used today on massive scale, this approach will hide the data from the adversary and even if the channel is compromised, they would be needing the password to break both the steganography and encryption saving us from the almost every attack in the book. While still the steganalysis can compromise the hidden data, we would be dealing with the same in the upcoming section such as we can easily fool the tools to identify a processed image.
